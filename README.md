# SocketProgramming
Within the scope of this project, communication between applications using socket programming was implemented using C++ language. 
The created server-client console applications are in the form of messaging applications.
“localhost” is set as the communication address and port selection is left to the user.
If a full port is selected, re-entry is allowed.
The protocol shown in the MainLogic.png file has been applied in communication.
